/* We need to be able to identify whether or not a movie is a "blockbuster" in MovieStarz.

In order to be a blockbuster, a movie must fulfill the following criteria:

It's a big hit
It is new
It has awards or it can have a sequel
It is not rated X
Set the isBlockBuster using the given variables and the appropriate logical operators. Remember that you can specify an "order of operations" by using parentheses.
